            Specialist Care Ltd was founded with a simple but powerful vision:
            to provide safe, supportive, and person-centred care for adults
            whose needs were too often overlooked.
          </span>

          <span>
            In my work, I saw far too many people unable to leave hospital
            settings because of complex mental health needs, substance misuse
            histories, or behaviours that made it difficult for them to find a
            suitable placement. I felt strongly that this had to change â€” that
            everyone deserves dignity, respect, and the chance to live in a
            place they can call home.
          </span>
          <br /><br />
          <span>
            That conviction led to the opening of our first home, Little Acorns
            residential home in eastbourne, in 2020. We wanted it to feel warm
            and welcoming, a true home where people could feel safe, valued, and
            supported. Little Acorns set the standard for everything Specialist
            Care Ltd stands for today: care that empowers, homes that nurture,
            and opportunities that inspire independence.
          </span>
          <br /><br />
          <span>
            Since then, we have grown steadily, supporting more individuals with
            complex needs while staying true to our founding values of empathy,
            respect, equality, care, and independence. As directors, we remain
            hands-on and committed, ensuring Specialist Care Ltd continues to
            evolve while never losing sight of why we started: to empower
            wellness and enrich lives.
